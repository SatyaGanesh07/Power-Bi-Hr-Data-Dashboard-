### Problem Statement

Organizations today face high employee attrition, uncertain promotion pipelines, and retrenchment pressures, all of which create hurdles in building a stable, engaged workforce. Decisions often lack data-driven transparency, leading to missed opportunities for retention, poor work satisfaction, and ineffective talent management.[1]

### Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to deliver a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that enables HR managers and organizational leaders to:
- Monitor attrition and retention trends.
- Identify employees at risk of retrenchment.
- Recognize high-potential candidates due for promotion.
- Analyze key factors like satisfaction, tenure, department, and more for targeted HR interventions.[2][3][1]

### Methodology

1. **Data Gathering:** Integrated raw HR records, including demographics, performance, job roles, and business travel from internal data sources.[4][1]
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned, consolidated, and structured datasets in CSV format for valid analytic models.
3. **Power BI Modeling:** Created data models with relevant measures and relationships, focused on KPIs such as retention rate, promotion eligibility, retrenchment risk, job satisfaction, and more.
4. **Visualization & Insight:** Designed interactive reports and dashboards in Power BI to empower real-time business insight, with dynamic filters, DAX calculations, and user-friendly visuals.
5. **Validation & Review:** Internally validated outputs with sample scenarios, iterative feedback from actual HR users, and refined the deliverables based on their practical needs.[3][1][2]

### Final Deliverable

The final output is a ready-to-use Power BI dashboard (.pbix file), accompanied by:
- Fully cleaned and annotated datasets in CSV format.
- Complete documentation, including data dictionary and usage instructions.
- Repository containing visual screenshots, key interpretation notes, and sample queries for further exploration.[1][2][3]
- A section on KPIs, assumptions, and actionable recommendations interactive within the dashboard, offering HR teams a single source of truth for critical workforce analytics.
